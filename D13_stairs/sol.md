let's break down the problem step by step:

Problem Statement: You are given a staircase with a certain number of steps. You can climb the staircase by taking either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. The task is to find the number of distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.

Example: Suppose you have a staircase with 3 steps. You can climb it in the following distinct ways:

[1, 1, 1] (Climbing one step at a time)
[1, 2] (Climbing one step then two steps)
[2, 1] (Climbing two steps then one step)
Approach to Solve: This problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming. We can observe that to reach step i on the staircase, we can either come from step i-1 by taking one step, or from step i-2 by taking two steps. So, the total number of ways to reach step i is the sum of the ways to reach step i-1 and step i-2.

Base Cases:

If there are 0 steps, there's only one way to climb (by doing nothing).
If there's only 1 step, there's only one way to climb (by taking one step).
Dynamic Programming Solution:

We create an array dp of size A + 1, where dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach step i.
We initialize dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1 as base cases.
Then, we iterate from 2 to A, and at each step, we compute dp[i] as dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2].
Finally, we return dp[A] as the answer.
Constraints: The problem constraints specify that the number of steps A will be between 1 and 36, inclusive.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of steps. This is because we need to iterate through all steps once.
Space Complexity: O(N), since we're using an additional array of size N for dynamic programming.
By following this approach, we can efficiently compute the number of distinct ways to climb the staircase with a given number of steps.
