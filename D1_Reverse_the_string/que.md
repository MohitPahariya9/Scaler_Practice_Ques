module.exports = {
    solve: function(A) {
        // Split the string into words
        let words = A.split(/\s+/);

        // Reverse the list of words
        let reversedWords = words.reverse();

        // Join the reversed words with single spaces
        let reversedString = reversedWords.join(' ');

        return reversedString.trim(); // Remove leading and trailing spaces
    }
};

Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

Module Exports:
module.exports is a special object in Node.js used to define the exported contents of a module. In this case, it's exporting an object containing a single function called solve.

solve function:
This function takes a single parameter A, which is expected to be a string.
It's responsible for reversing the string word by word according to the given instructions.

Splitting the string into words:
A.split(/\s+/) is used to split the input string A into an array of words.
The regular expression /\s+/ matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.), effectively splitting the string wherever one or more whitespace characters are encountered.
This creates an array named words containing all the words from the original string.

Reversing the list of words:
words.reverse() reverses the order of elements in the words array.
This effectively reverses the order of words in the string.

Joining the reversed words:
reversedWords.join(' ') joins the elements of the reversedWords array into a single string.
Each word is separated by a single space, as specified by the ' ' argument passed to the join() method.

Removing leading and trailing spaces:
reversedString.trim() removes any leading and trailing spaces from the resulting reversed string.
This ensures that the reversed string does not have leading or trailing spaces, as instructed in the problem statement.

Returning the reversed string:
The function returns the final reversed string with the leading and trailing spaces removed.
Overall, this code effectively reverses the input string word by word while handling the specified conditions such as removing leading/trailing spaces and reducing multiple spaces between words to a single space.
