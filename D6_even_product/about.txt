This code defines a function countDistinctOperations(A) that takes an array A as input and calculates the count of distinct operations that can be performed on the array elements. An operation is defined as multiplying an element of the array by 2. The function then returns the count modulo MOD (which is 1000000007).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

const MOD = 1000000007;: Defines a constant MOD representing the modulo value.

let oddCount = 0;: Initializes a variable oddCount to keep track of the number of odd elements in the array.

Loop through the array A and count the number of odd elements:

javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
    if (A[i] % 2 !== 0) {
        oddCount++;
    }
}
If there are no odd elements in the array, return 0, indicating that no operations are needed:

javascript
Copy code
if (oddCount === 0) {
    return 0;
}
Otherwise, calculate 2^oddCount modulo MOD:

javascript
Copy code
let result = 1;
for (let i = 0; i < oddCount; i++) {
    result = (result * 2) % MOD;
}
Subtract 1 from the result because the case where no operation is performed is not considered distinct:

javascript
Copy code
return (result - 1 + MOD) % MOD;
Test cases:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(countDistinctOperations([1, 3]));     // Output: 3
console.log(countDistinctOperations([3]));        // Output: 1
console.log(countDistinctOperations([469, 335])); // Output: 1
The output of each test case demonstrates the count of distinct operations required for the given arrays.
